.. important::

    This data is only intended for testing purposes in a fresh TYPO3 installation.
    **Do not run the upgrade wizard `Create member placeholder data
    for clubmanager extension` with "Yes" in a live installation, because it will
    empty the following tables and refill them with placeholder data**:

    * sys_category
    * fe_users
    * fe_groups
    * tx_clubmanager_domain_model_member
    * tx_clubmanager_domain_model_location

.. warning::

    **Run the upgrade wizard `Create member placeholder data
    for clubmanager extension` only in a test environment with "Yes "**.


.. note::

    The :guilabel:`Upgrade Wizard` can only run if in the global
    extension settings the
    ref:`UID of the default storage page for members <extensionConfigurationstoragPid>`
    has been set!

Run upgrade wizard
==================

* You must have admin rights.
* Go to :guilabel:`Admin Tools` > :guilabel:`Upgrade`.
* Click :guilabel:`Run Upgrade Wizard`
* Click on :guilabel:`Execute` in the wizard `Create member placeholder data for clubmanager extension`.

1000 member records with associated location and frontend user record were created.
In addition, system categories were created for sorting of member and site records.
The system categories will be created on the root page of your pagetree. You can
transfer them afterwards to your "Sys Categories Storage".

.. note::

    The placeholder categories must still be defined via
    :ref:`Extension Configuration uidCategoryMember <extensionConfigurationUidParentMember>`
    and
    :ref:`Extension Configuration uidCategoryLocation <extensionConfigurationUidParentLocation>`.
